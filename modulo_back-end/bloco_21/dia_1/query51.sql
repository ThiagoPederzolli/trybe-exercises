Write a query that displays the first name and the length of the first name for all employees whose name starts with the letters 'A', 'J' or 'M'. Give each column an appropriate label. Sort the results by the employees' first names.
```
SELECT first_name "Name",
LENGTH(first_name) "Length"
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%'
OR first_name LIKE 'M%'
OR first_name LIKE 'A%'
ORDER BY first_name ;
```
